# Summary

Within this project I have produce a crypto data visualization website. This website includes 5 crypto currencies (BTC, ETH, LUNA, DOGE, XLM). Both numerical and sentimental data are displayed using Plotly. The numerical data is represented in a graph format showing crypto rates (in GBP) alongside the time (in mm/dd/yyyy format). the numerical data was obtained using third party web service cryptocompare (https://www.cryptocompare.com/ ). The sentiment data for all 5 crypto currencies are shown using a pie chart showing positive, negative, neutral, and mixed results from tweets about the crypto. The front end of the website was created using html, css, and javascript. This is hosted in the cloud using Amazon S3. The back end is also run in the cloud with serverless technology.
